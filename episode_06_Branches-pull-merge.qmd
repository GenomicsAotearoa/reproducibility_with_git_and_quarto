# Branches, pulling and merging

- possilby re name this file Pulling, branches and merging?

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
# Key points
- `git pull origin main`  
- Can make new branches to work on major issues, then merge them into main

## Pulling repositories from the server to our local computer

Pulling takes changes made on a remote repository and brings them down into your local repository. For example, say you are collaborating on a project and your partner has made some changes and pushed them up to the github repo. You now want to pull down all those changes and keep working on the project locally.

Let's have a go at this.

### 1. Add a README file

Go to the recipes repository page on github. You will see an option to add a "README" file.

Click "Add a README" and add some info, e.g.:

```
This repo is to house all my favourite recipes :)
```

By adding this file directly on the GitHub server, we have simulated the same scenario as if someone had pushed this file to the repo instead.

# But what if I don't want people to be able to push to my repo?
By default, noone can push to a repo that you have made under your own GitHub account. But, anyone can clone or fork them. To restrict or modify acccess, under general settings you can add collaborators, or you can change the visibility of your repo from public to private.

Click commit changes:

Then you will be prompted to add a commit message. Add something sensible such as "Add initial README" and click commit changes.

You will then see your new file in your recipes repo with the new commit message:

### 2. Pull changes down

Back on your local command line, navigate to your recipes directory:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/recipes
```

Now run the following to pull changes to your local computer:

```bash
git pull origin main
```
And you'll see an output like this:

```
From github.com:username/recipes
 * branch            main       -> FETCH_HEAD
Updating 1fecf68..7ae1866
Fast-forward
 README.md | 2 ++
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 README.md
```

Run `ls` to see the files in your directory and confirm we now have the README file locally.

#### How does pull work? 

`git pull` does not blindly overwrite uncommitted local changes. When we pull everything from the server, the  most common scenario is the "fast-forward", such as we have done here. Git checks if you have changes that haven’t been committed yet. If you do, Git will try to merge the changes from the server with your local changes. If there’s a conflict (for example, if you and someone else changed the same line in a file), Git will stop and ask you to resolve the conflict before continuing. In the most common case (when you haven’t made any local changes or your local changes are already committed) Git can just add the new changes from the server on top of your work. This is called a “fast-forward” update, and it’s what happened in our example. Our local directory now matches the content in the Github server. There are different scenarios if your local file is behind and if there are merge conflicts. In this workshop, we will not get in to how to deal with conflicts; you can [read more about it here](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/09-conflict.html) and more on recovering files and [exploring history here.](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/05-history.html)

To avoid conflicts, we can manage our workflow with branches and by utlising handy functionality such as issues and projects when collaborating with others (see episode 07 ["Collaborating"](episode_07_Collaborating.qmd))


## Branches

So far, we have been workng on one branch, called main. We can add more branches to our tree, make any changes we wish safely wohtout affecting the mnain branchm and when we are ready we can 'Compare and pull' these chnages into the main branch. Generally, we want to make brnaches to work on when we are doing bug fixes of our code or testing out major restructuring or styling and we don't want these to be pushed to the main branch just yet.

Let's practise making a new branch. 

Back in RStudio, we will intialise a new branch

testing new recipe formulation




### merging (compare and pull?) our branch into main

#### merge conflicts
