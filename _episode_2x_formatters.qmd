Format refers to things like spacing, line breaks, the use of objectNamesLikeThis or ones_named_like_this. Good formatting makes our code much more legible and will save the reader (possibly future you) a lot of time. But, writing in good format can take a lot of practice and it definitely takes time. One option is to bring in a formatter, a package that can do take care of this for you.
