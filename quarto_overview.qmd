What is Quarto? 

What is the purpose of Quarto (and it's equivalent systems)?

- How does Quarto improve reproducibility? What are some examples?

Basic syntax (generate a pdf) 

- A basic CV or "About me" document:

- Formatting: headings, lists, bold and italics

- Embed an image, generate a table, headings, italics and bold face


Upgrading to a website

- Minimal changes required due to Quarto's cross-output capabilities

- A website could: be an about page (your elevator pitch - an ideal pinned repo), a lab on-boarding page, or a walkthrough of a method with output ("showcasing your story").

Preview and Render, git and Publishing

- Practice practice practice! Theme, styles.

- Publishing with github pages.





## Practically, what will we do today? 

Everyone will generate a pdf and a published website. 

We will demonstrate how to incorporate code and text notes into a document.
