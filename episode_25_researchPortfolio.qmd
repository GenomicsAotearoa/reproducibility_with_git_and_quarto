title: Building our own research portfolio
toc: true
---


## Aims

- Learn how to publish a website.
- Gain experience with Quarto, explore options around format, theme, styles.css, *etc.,* to create a polished website.
- Pin a repo to showcase your capabilities.
- Gain confidence in working publicly. 


As an alternative to creating a research portfolio website, you may instead choose to focus on creating a website that documents one of your particular projects, or some other form of website. While we recommend the concept of a pinned github repo to highlight your abilities as a researcher and bioinformatician, how you do this is up to you. 


## Why a portfolio website? 

If you want to progress in bioinformatics, you should assume that people (future employers) will look at your github. Having a set of tidy repos that document your workflow is the minimum you should aim for. In addition to these tidy repos, we can build a single repo that directs and guides viewers through our github and highlights our key skills. 

Aside from github repos it can be useful to create websites as a way to market either yourself and your work, or the work of your lab group. Quarto can make this easy. [Jadey Ryan](https://jadeyryan.com/) has a great website that really showcases what a Quarto website can look like.

To get a better understanding of why I am recommending this and what we are trying to do, we recommend this talk from posit::conf(2024) titled "[Github - How to tell your professional story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-bPjavai5A&list=PL9HYL-VRX0oSFkdF4fJeY63eGDvgofcbn&index=20)". In this talk, Dr. Abigail Haddad outlines how Github can be used to demonstrate not just the raw coding skills you use frequently, but also the auxilliary skills that define how you work - your problem solving skills, your practices, and how you communicate. 

We are going to take some of the advice from that talk, which says that all of your github should be used to *actively* demonstrate your skills and tell your story, and we are going to compress it down to a single github repo which will convey (or at least introduce) your story. We will Pin this repo so that it's the first thing people see when they visit your github page, and publish it as a working website so that you also have a link you can drop into LinkedIn or Bluesky posts, incorporate into your email signatures, whenever you feel it's appropriate to do some self-marketing. 


## Initial setup 

Using skills from yesterday and today's workshops:

- Initiate a new, public github repo with a name like "Work Portfolio" or equivalent. 

- In RStudio, start a New Project, and use the Version Control option to link it to the new repo, and select where you want the directory to be (e.g., select 'Desktop', and your new directory will appear on your desktop) 

- Create three .qmd files. For each file, set the YAML header to include an appropriate title and add at least one header and a piece of sample text to each document: 

    - `index.qmd`{style="color:blue"}. Index.qmd will work as the landing page for the site, and could include something like the short blurb found at the top of a CV.
    
    - `portfolio.qmd`{style="color:blue"}. Portfolio will contain hyperlinks to your work - either to other github repos, publications, google scholar account, LinkedIn account *etc.,* (it will be the definitive, exhaustive set of your work).
    
    - `research_focus.qmd`{style="color:blue"}. Research_focus.qmd will include a written statement about your focus as a researcher.

    - Create a `_quarto.yml`{style="color:blue"} file using the template from the previous section. Include `index.qmd`{style="color:blue"} first, then `research_focus.qmd`{style="color:blue"} and then `portfolio.qmd`{style="color:blue"}.

# Make the _quarto.yml file for me please:

```bash
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: docs

website:
  title: "My work portfolio"
  navbar:
    left:
      - text: "My name"
        href: index.qmd
      - text: "My research focus"
        href: research_focus.qmd
      - text: "My portfolio"
        href: portfolio.qmd

format:
  html:
    theme: minty
```

:::

**Note:** these initial files are templates only, and will be populated later. 

Save all four files and click "Render" in RStudio. You will now have created a rudimentary structure for your work portfolio website.

# What should my website look like? Show me an example

We encourage you after the workshop to spend some time developing your research portfolio website, populated with your own real information.

Here as an example, we have created a website as if written by the scientist [Dr Barbara McClintock.](https://chloevdb.github.io/work-portfolio-barbara-mcclintock/)

You can use this text to populate your own if you'd like to use an example for now:

# Welcome to My Research Portfolio

![Barbara McClintock (1902-1992), Department of Genetics, Carnegie Institution at Cold Spring Harbor, New York, shown in her laboratory. [Photo: From the  Smithsonian Institution Archives, Accession 90-105, Science Service Records, Image No. SIA2008-5609](http://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_arc_306310)](images/barbaramcclintock.jpg){width=80%}



Hello, I’m **Barbara McClintock**, an American cytogeneticist fascinated by the dynamic nature of the genome.  
My work with **maize chromosomes** led to the discovery of genetic recombination, chromosome breakage, and eventually, **transposable elements** — genes that can move within the genome.

I completed my PhD in Botany at **Cornell University** in 1927, and spent much of my career exploring how chromosomes behave and control genetic expression in maize.  
In 1983, I was awarded the **Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine** for the discovery of genetic transposition.

This site serves as a portfolio of my research, publications, and ongoing scientific interests.

My lifelong scientific interest lies in understanding how **chromosomes behave and change** — and how such behavior influences genetic expression and heredity.

## Cytogenetics of Maize
Working with *Zea mays*, I developed techniques to visualize chromosomes under the microscope.  
These methods enabled me to:  
- Demonstrate **crossing-over** during meiosis.  
- Identify the roles of **telomeres** and **centromeres** in maintaining chromosome stability.  
- Track structural rearrangements in chromosomes across generations.

## Discovery of Transposable Elements
In the 1940s and 1950s, I discovered **“jumping genes”**, or **transposons** — mobile genetic elements that can change their position within the genome.  
This finding revealed that the genome is **not static**, but instead **dynamic and responsive** to its environment.

## Later Research and Broader Impact
My later work extended into the **cytogenetics and ethnobotany of South American maize races**, integrating field studies with laboratory cytology.  
These findings helped connect genetic variability with the evolutionary adaptation of maize to local environments.

## Refining the site

Here we will look at a number of options through the `_quarto.yml`{style="color:blue"} file to improve the look of the website. 

### Improved navigation and layout

#### Sidebar navigation

In the last section we added a navbar along the top of the page for website navigation. An alternative to this is sidebar navigation:

- In the `_quarto.yml`{style="color:blue"} document, replace `navbar:` with `sidebar:` 

- Add a new line below `sidebar`, indent and add `style: "docked"`. 

- Add a new line and (same indentation level as `style:`, because it is an argument under `sidebar`), remove the `left:`, and add `contents:`. This is then followed individual `.qmd`{style="color:blue"} documents with `text` and `href` as before. 

::: {.callout-warning collapse="true"}
# Help! What should my _quarto.yml look like now?

Your `_quarto.yml`{style="color:blue"} should now look like this:

```bash
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: docs

website:
  title: "My work portfolio"
  sidebar:
    style: "docked"
    contents:
      - text: "My name"
        href: index.qmd
      - text: "My portfolio"
        href: portfolio.qmd
      - text: "My research focus"
        href: research_focus.qmd

format:
  html:
    theme: minty
```

:::

#### Sections

We can group pages under a header in sidebar navigation. Clicking on the header will open a drop-down menu. Each section can be given it's own name, and can have any number of individual pages nested below it through the "contents:" key. 

Sections are very useful for *e.g.,* a website that focuses on discrete aspects (two day protocols, wetlab and drylab sections *etc.,*)


::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Example sidebar and section .yml

![Sidebar and sections example](figures/sidebar_and_sections.png)

:::

### Adding personal details: github icons, footer, light and dark

#### Site icons

We can add a range of icons to our navigation menu and provide links for these icons. This provides an easy and clear way for site visitors to view your other, more commonly used accounts. Commonly used icons include github/linkedIn/bluesky, with [thousands of icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) available for use. 

Add the code below to a new line in the `website` section of the `_quarto.yml`{style="color:blue"}  file. Note that `navbar` should be at the same indentation level as `sidebar`. You can swap the href link (which is currently to the generic github site) to your own github. 

```bash
  navbar:
    right:
      - icon: github
        href: https://github.com/
        aria-label: GitHub
```

#### Footer

Add a footer with: 

```bash
  page-footer:
    center:
      - text: "Built with love and Quarto"
      - href: https://quarto.org
```

#### Themes light and dark

In addition to selecting a single theme as we have done in the previous section of this workshop, we can enable both a light and dark mode using themes. The easiest way to do this is to choose the simple themes "flatly" and "darkly", but you can select any themes you prefer. 

To do this, under `theme:`, add two new lines with the key-value pairs `light: flatly` and `dark: darkly`. After rendering we can now switch between light and dark modes. 

```bash
theme:
  light: flatly
  dark: darkly
```

### styles.css

In addition to the pre-built format that themes can provide we can also customise our sites with a `styles.css`{style="color:blue"} file. This a "Cascading Style Sheets" document, which can be used to override all of the Quarto defaults for HTML documents. The .css file is used to manipulate fonts, choose colours, layout, background for code cells, side and navbar aesthetics, table text alignment - *almost every visual aspect* can be changed with a styles.css file. 

The `styles.css`{style="color:blue"}  file is written in css - it is not Quarto specific, and requires reasonably detailed knowledge. We recommend using templates sourced online or chatGPT equivalents for building a `styles.css`{style="color:blue"} template which you can then work from. 

Styles.css is stored in the top level of the directory. In the `_quarto.yml`{style="color:blue"} document under `format`, we can add a new line at the same indentation level as theme and added `css: styles.css` 

```bash
format:
  html:
    css: styles.css
```

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" appearance="minimal"}
# Example styles.css
Here we created one using ChatGPT, by asking it to create a styles.css file using the specified colour palette (these colours come from a [Kākāpō palette by Geoffrey Thomson](https://g-thomson.github.io/Manu/)). Copy-paste this text into a text file and save it as `styles.css`{style="color:blue"}:

## Publishing the site using GitHub Pages

To publish a website - that is, to take it from the local-only html file to a hosted site that is accessible via url - [there are a number of options](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/). Today we will focus on publishing through GitHub Pages. Within GitHub Pages there are three options for publishing (render to docs and publish, using the quarto publish command, or using a Github Action). We will use the simplest option, render to docs and then instruct GitHub to publish from the docs directory. 


### 1. Setting up 

1. In the `_quarto.yml`{style="color:blue"} file, make sure that we have `output-dir: docs` under `project`. Quarto render will then output all files to the docs directory. 

2. We need to add a specific file that tells GitHub pages *not* to do additional processing of our site (github has built in methods for publishing, which we do not want to use here). Under the Terminal tab in RStudio, run: 

```bash
touch .nojekyll
```

The file is not rendered - starting with a `.`{style="color:green"} means that the file is not rendered and is instead treated as a high-level argument. 

### 2. Render, add, commit, push

First, save all your open `.qmd`{style="color:blue"} files.  Then, click the 'Render' button on **every single `.qmd`{style="color:blue"} file.** This will create a `html`{style="color:blue"} file in `docs/`{style="color:blue"} for each qmd file. 

While still in RStudio terminal, run:

```bash
git add . 
```
(The `.`{style="color:green"} adds everything, alternatively type: `git add docs`)


```bash
git commit -m "publish to docs/"
```

```bash
git push
```

(If you get an error message here, you might need to type `git push origin main`)

Our new rendered docs should now be stored safely in our repo on the GitHub server. 

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
# Is there a faster way to render all my files?

Yes there is!

There are two ways you could do this:

**1. Save all files, close RStudio, re-open RStudio.**  
  a) You will now see a tab appear that says 'Build'.  
  b) Click the button that says 'Render Website' and all your qmd files in the directory will be rendered. The qmd files don't need to be open in RStudio. Note that this only works if you made an RStudio project first (we did this in  ["Intial setup"](#initial-setup)).

![](images-quarto/quarto-render-02.png)

**2. Render from the command line**  
  a) Make sure you have [Quarto CLI tools installed first](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/). Type `quarto --version` to check.  
  b) Type `quarto render` in terminal. All qmd files will render. You can confirm this by checking that recent html files have appeared in docs, and by running `quarto preview` in terminal to confirm your website looks how you expect it to. 

:::


### 3. Deploy from main/docs 

Navigate to the GitHub repo for the page you wish to deploy. Under `Settings`{style="color:black"}  > `Pages`{style="color:black"}, use the dropdown menus under the **Branch** header to select `main`{style="color:black"} branch, and then switch the directory from `/(root)`{style="color:black"}  to `/docs`{style="color:black"}. When ready, click `Save`{style="color:black"}. 

The page should refresh with a new note saying "Your Github pages site is currently being built...". 

![Deploying the github page](figures/deployPage.png)

Refresh the page to see the url for the new site and a button to Visit the site. Copy this url, return to the main page for the repo, and use the buttons on the github site to edit the About and/or Readme. Alternatively, back in RStudio open the README.md file and add the url there. 

Explore and share your now live portfolio webpage! 👏

### 4. Pin your repo 

On the GitHub website you can pin up to six repos as visible on your main landing page, with the remaining repos being visible under the repos tab. Once your research portfolio website is underway we recommend pinning it, alongside your most completed and well-documented repos, so that they will be the first thing visitors will see. 


## Summary 

You can reasonably expect people to look at your github repos. Creating a repo to guide viewers through your portfolio of research is a a good way to influence what people will see. 

With quarto we have a great level of control over the documents we create with arguments in the _quarto.yml file, through the use of themes, and a dedicated styles.css file.

There are multiple ways to freely publish your documents as websites. Github pages works well with quarto docs and the method shown here is simple and easy to follow.
