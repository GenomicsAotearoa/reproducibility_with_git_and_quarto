# Collaborating and organising your workflow

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
# Key points
- `git clone` copies a remote repository to create a local repository with a remote called origin automatically set up.
- use 'Issues' to track and fix any issues in a transparent way
- use 'Projects' to collaboratively track tasks
- 'Organisations' share repos and have different roles and access levels for members

## Cloning remote repositories

Often we want to download other people's repositories to our local machine. One main reaosn for this can be because you want to use a set of scripts developed for a workflow. 

To do this, we use `git clone`.

First, navigate on GitHub to a repository that you want to download.  If you have one in mind already go ahead and use that; for this example we will use the Kākāpo Genome project repo.

### Best practises 

To avoid conflicts (and headaches!) we can manage our workflow by always:  
- Checking our file status with `git status`  
- At the end of each day, remember to save your work by running `git add`, `git commit` and `git push`.  
- At the start of each day, check if there have been any changes to the repo on the server, and `git pull` as necessary.  
- Utilise branches and handy functionality such as 'Issues' and 'Projects' when collaborating with others -- or even just for yourself!  

### Burn it all down

Sometimes our repos get too messy and complicated, and we just want to burn it all down. 

This website called [Happy git with R](https://happygitwithr.com) by Jenny Bryan and Jim Hester is a fantastic guide on how to make Git/GitHub work with RStudio. If all else fails, they suggest in [section 37](https://happygitwithr.com/burn) to simply "Burn it all down". In short, make a copy of all the files you want to keep locally, delete your repo on GitHub and start anew.
