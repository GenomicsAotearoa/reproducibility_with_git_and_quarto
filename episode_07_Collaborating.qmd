- use 'Issues' to track and fix any issues in a transparent way
- use 'Projects' to collaboratively track tasks

### Burn it all down

In this workshop we have laid out some options for best practice when working in Git/GitHub. However, sometimes our repos get too big and complicated. 

This website called [Happy git with R](https://happygitwithr.com) by Jenny Bryan and Jim Hester is a fantastic guide on how to make Git/GitHub work with RStudio. If all else fails, they suggest in [section 37](https://happygitwithr.com/burn) to simply "Burn it all down". In short, make a copy of all the files you want to keep locally, delete your repo on GitHub and start anew.
